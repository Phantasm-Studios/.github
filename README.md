## New Goal
- To be built on open source three.js code-mirror nwjs javascript webGL cannon.js
- It will be a game engine for games but also allows you to Create interactive experiences for your webpage! Design, edit, code, all in one place! 
- feautures like:
  - Graphical Editor - Familiar user interface similar to the ones you already know.
  - 3D Graphics - Graphics powered by three.js with dynamic ligths, shadows, post-processing, etc.
  - Physics - Fully features 3D physics engine powered by cannon.js
  - JS Scripts - Easy to learn language, familiar for web and game developers.
  - 2D Mode
  - WebVR - Ready for web virtual reality, on mobile and desktop platforms.
  - Advanced materials  - Graphical material editor similar to the ones found in 3D design tools.
  - Particles - GPU accelerated particle system powered by SPE.
  - Drag and drop - Drag and drop files into the editor, it just works.
  - Spine animations - Create 2D animations using Esoteric spine animation tool and import them to the engine.
  - WebAudio - Audio engine built on top of web audio API with support for positional audio.
  - Multi-platform editor - editor was build on top of nwjs it works on windows, linux and OS X.

- Built on [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library
  - Real time lighting and shadow map support
  - three.js libraries can be imported into the editor
  - Wide range of file formats supported (gltf, dae, obj, fbx, 3ds, ...)
- [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) and [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) exports for desktop and mobile deployment
- Physics powered by [cannon.js](https://schteppe.github.io/cannon.js/)
- Compatible with [WebXR](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) for Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality



#### Embedding Application
